> [!NOTE]  
> Due to a long-term health condition (post-COVID since almost three years), I am unable to continue developing this project. Although many amazing contributors have helped over the years, I am unsure when I will be able to resume work. This is my most popular project (over 61 stars!), and I hope others will continue to improve the client and library for various use cases, such as Home Assistant integration. Thank you for your understanding and support.

## About The Project

This repository aims to reverse engineer the [iDotMatrix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tech.idotmatrix&pli=1) Android App for pixel screen displays like [this one on Aliexpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006105517779.html). The goal is to provide a simple library which you can use to connect to your display(s).

## Built With

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
* [bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak)
* [pillow](https://python-pillow.org)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running or use the latest pypi package follow these simple example steps:

### Prerequisites

Please install the following for your distribution (Windows may work but it is untested):

* latest Python3
* Python3 Virtual Env

### Installation

#### use latest github source code

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/derkalle4/python3-idotmatrix-library.git
```

2. Install the latest version locally

```sh
cd python3-idotmatrix-library/
pip install .
```

#### install latest public version via pypi

```sh
pip install idotmatrix
```

## Usage

If you want to use the integrated bleak library to talk to your device, you have to initialize the ConnectionManager first. If you omit this step all classes will return the bytecode which you then can send to the device with your own bluetooth implementation.

```python
import asyncio
from idotmatrix import ConnectionManager

async def main():
    # connect to first found iDotMatrix Pixel Display
    conn = ConnectionManager()
    await conn.connectBySearch()
    # do something with this connection afterwards

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        asyncio.run(main())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        quit()
```

### Chronograph

The Chronograph has 4 different modes. Using mode 1 will automatically open the Chronograph on the device and start the countdown. This should be the first mode used or otherwise the device may does not respond properly.

- 0 = reset
- 1 = (re)start
- 2 = pause
- 3 = continue after pause

```python
from idotmatrix import Chronograph

chronograph = Chronograph()
await chronograph.setMode(1)
```

## Roadmap

If you want to contribute please focus on the reverse-engineering part because my personal skills are not that good. Many thanks for all contributions! If you want to dive deep into other issues please check for "#TODO" comments in the source code as well.
